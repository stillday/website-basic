# Repository Discontinuation Announcement

Dear users,

I am writing to inform you that I have made the decision to discontinue the development and maintenance of this repository. This decision was not made lightly but reflects my desire and necessity to focus on new technologies and projects that align better with my current goals and interests.

## Background of the Decision

- **New Technologies:** My focus has shifted towards newer, advanced technologies that unfortunately do not align with the approaches and structures of this repository.
- **Development Priorities:** To ensure that I can maintain the quality and innovation of my work, I need to concentrate my resources and attention on these new projects.

## Consequences for Users

- **No Further Updates:** There will be no new features, improvements, or security updates made to this repository.
- **Archiving:** The repository will be moved to an archived status, meaning it will remain readable for future references but will no longer be actively maintained.
- **No Support:** I will no longer be able to process support requests, issues, or contributions for this repository.

## Recommendations for Users

- **Seek Alternatives:** I encourage everyone to look for alternative projects or solutions that might meet your needs.
- **Community Initiatives:** If there is interest in continuing or taking over the project, I am supportive of discussions within the community to find a potential new maintainer.

## Closing Words

I want to thank everyone who has supported, used, and contributed to the growth of this project. Your support has been immensely valuable and is greatly appreciated. I look back with pride on what we have achieved and look forward to what lies ahead as I embrace new challenges and technologies.

For further information or if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.

With sincere thanks and best wishes for your future endeavors,
